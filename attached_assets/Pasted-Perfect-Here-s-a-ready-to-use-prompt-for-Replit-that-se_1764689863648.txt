Prompt to Paste

Create a React + TailwindCSS frontend for a Monad ERC‑8004 prediction market. Include:

1️⃣ **Landing Page (Hero + Features)**

- Hero Section:
  - Headline: "Predict. Win. Earn. Real-time on Monad."
  - Subtext: "Bet on crypto, sports, and pop-culture events with trustless ERC-8004 oracles."
  - Animated CTA button: "Connect Wallet"
  - Optional animated graphic showing live vote bars

- How It Works Section:
  1. Pick an Event → YES / NO
  2. Place Your Bet → Stake MEME tokens
  3. Oracle Confirms → ERC-8004 agent submits outcome
  4. Claim Winnings → Automatic payout

- Features Section:
  - Real-Time Updates → vote totals & payouts update instantly
  - Trustless Oracle → ERC-8004 agent verified
  - Multiple Event Categories → Crypto, Sports, Pop-Culture
  - Leaderboards & Rewards → NFT badges, streak rewards

- Event Preview Cards:
  - Show 2-3 example events with countdown timers and live vote totals

- CTA Section:
  - Buttons: "Connect Wallet", "View Active Events"

- Footer:
  - About / Docs / FAQ / Social Links / Disclaimer

---

2️⃣ **Live Vote Chart Component**

- Use Chart.js (Bar chart) to display YES/NO votes
- Highlight winning option:
  - Green = winner
  - Red = loser
  - Blue = user bet if applicable
- Updates live via WebSocket / SSE from backend
- Show numeric vote totals above bars
- Optional animation when votes update or result is revealed

Example props for React component:

<EventVoteChart
  yesVotes={70}
  noVotes={30}
  outcome={true} // true = YES, false = NO
  userBet="YES"
/>

---

3️⃣ **Integration Details**

- Landing page fetches **active events** from backend API
- Each event card includes **vote totals chart component**
- When ERC-8004 agent submits outcome:
  - Update chart colors
  - Show user payout card
  - Animate result highlight (confetti or fade)
- Ensure **mobile responsive design** (stack cards vertically)

---

4️⃣ **File Structure Suggestion**

/frontend
  - package.json
  - src/
    - App.jsx
    - index.css (TailwindCSS)
    - components/
      - LandingPage.jsx
      - HeroSection.jsx
      - FeaturesSection.jsx
      - EventCard.jsx
      - EventVoteChart.jsx
      - ResultCard.jsx
      - Leaderboard.jsx
    - utils/
      - api.js (fetch events, user bets)
      - websocket.js (real-time updates)

.env.example (store backend URL, API keys)

---

5️⃣ **Styling Guidelines**

- Dark theme with gradients or subtle patterns
- Primary colors:
  - Green = winning option
  - Red = losing option
  - Blue = user bets / action buttons
- Clean, modern fonts (sans-serif)
- Subtle hover effects and animations
- Countdown timers clearly visible on event cards
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

---

6️⃣ **Optional Enhancements**

- Animated vote bars filling in real-time
- Confetti / highlight when outcome revealed
- Leaderboard snippet on landing page
- Event category filters (Crypto / Sports / Pop-Culture)
- Streak badges or NFT icons for top predictors

💡 How This Works in Replit
	1.	Create a new Replit React project
	2.	Paste the prompt in README or Notes for reference
	3.	Scaffold components (LandingPage.jsx, EventVoteChart.jsx, etc.)
	4.	Install dependencies:

npm install react react-dom tailwindcss chart.js socket.io-client

	5.	Connect backend via WebSocket to push live vote totals and oracle outcome
	6.	Start frontend:

npm start


⸻

This gives you both a landing page and live vote chart fully integrated and ready to connect with your ERC‑8004 backend logic.

If you want, I can also write the actual React component code for EventVoteChart.jsx + a sample EventCard.jsx with live updates so you can literally copy-paste and run it.

Do you want me to do that next?
