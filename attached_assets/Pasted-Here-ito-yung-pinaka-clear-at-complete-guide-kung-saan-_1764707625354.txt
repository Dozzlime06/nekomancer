🧠 IMPORTANT

ERC-8004 Oracle = your server
Your server uses these APIs → decides result → sends signed result to your contract.

The blockchain DOES NOT call these APIs directly.

⸻

⭐ RECOMMENDED SETUP FOR YOU

Use 1–2 APIs per category:

Crypto:
	•	Dexscreener (onchain new coins)
	•	Coingecko (blue-chips)

Weather:
	•	OpenWeather

Sports:
	•	API-Football
	•	TheSportsDB

Politics / Events:
	•	NewsAPI

⸻

If you want, I can make you a full Oracle backend script (Node.js) that:
	•	fetches APIs
	•	decides winner
	•	signs ERC-8004 result
	•	sends to contract automatically
